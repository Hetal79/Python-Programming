A dictionary represents a group of elemnets in the form of key value pairs.
Dictionay in python is an unorderd collection.
Dictionary are mutable so we can modify it's item without changing their identity.
Dictionary are represend by using  curly bracket { }.
A dictionary is created in the form of key-value pair where keys can't be repeated and must be immutable and vlues can be of any data type and can be duplicated.
keys are case sensitive.
Ex:-
stu = {001:"jagruti",002:"Hetal",003:"Honey"}

While writing key we must follow the following rules:
# key should be unique.
# if we mention same key again, the old key will be overwritten.
# key should be immutable type .ex:integer, string, tuple
# we can not use list or dictionary AS A key.
# dictionary


dit = {"Hitechnology":"Hetal","GokulDham":"Jethalal","ashirvad":"Delhi","Godhra":"Honey"}

print(dit)
# to get a value out of the key
print(dit.items())
